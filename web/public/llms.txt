# BioArtlas

> Computational Clustering of Multi-Dimensional Complexity in Bioart

## Overview

BioArtlas is a computational framework for analyzing bioart—artworks that use living organisms, biological processes, and life science. The project analyzes 81 significant bioart works across 13 analytical dimensions using machine learning techniques.

## Research Summary

### Problem
Traditional taxonomic frameworks are insufficient for capturing the multidimensional complexity of bioart, as works simultaneously function as aesthetic objects, scientific instruments, ethical provocations, and political statements.

### Solution
BioArtlas provides an axis-aware computational representation that preserves semantic distinctions while enabling cross-dimensional comparison through systematic evaluation of 800+ representation–space–algorithm combinations.

### Dataset
- **81 bioart works** from 1930s to 2020s
- **13 analytical dimensions**: materiality, methodology, actor relations, ethical approaches, aesthetic strategies, epistemic functions, philosophical stances, social contexts, audience engagement, temporal scales, spatial scales, power dynamics, documentation practices
- **Notable artists included**: Eduardo Kac, Stelarc, Orlan, Critical Art Ensemble, Symbiotica, Heather Dewey-Hagborg, and more

### Technical Results
- **Optimal Configuration**: Agglomerative clustering (k=15) on 4D UMAP
- **Silhouette Coefficient**: 0.664 ± 0.008
- **Trustworthiness/Continuity**: ≈0.81

### Key Findings
1. **Artist-specific methodological cohesion**: Artists develop consistent approaches across multiple works
2. **Technique-based segmentation**: Works cluster by biological techniques (transgenic, tissue engineering, etc.)
3. **Temporal artistic evolution**: Observable shifts in bioart practices over decades
4. **Trans-temporal conceptual affinities**: Thematic connections across different time periods
