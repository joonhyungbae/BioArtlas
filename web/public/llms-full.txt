## 1. What is Bioart?

Bioart represents a convergence of:
- **Artistic practice**: Creative expression and aesthetic exploration
- **Biological science**: Use of living organisms, DNA, cells, tissues
- **Technological innovation**: Biotechnology, genetic engineering, synthetic biology

### Examples of Bioart Techniques:
- Transgenic organisms (genetically modified life forms as art)
- Tissue engineering and cell cultivation
- Biosemiotic inquiry (studying biological signs and communication)
- Microbial art
- DNA-based artworks
- Ecological interventions

## 2. The BioArtlas Dataset

### Scope
- **81 significant bioart works** spanning from the 1930s to 2020s
- Curated selection representing diverse approaches, techniques, and conceptual frameworks

### 13 Analytical Dimensions

Each artwork is analyzed across these dimensions:

1. **Materiality**: Physical and biological materials used
2. **Methodology**: Technical and artistic processes employed
3. **Actor Relations**: Relationships between human and non-human agents
4. **Ethical Approaches**: How works engage with bioethical questions
5. **Aesthetic Strategies**: Visual, sensory, and experiential qualities
6. **Epistemic Functions**: Knowledge production and questioning
7. **Philosophical Stances**: Underlying philosophical frameworks
8. **Social Contexts**: Engagement with social and political issues
9. **Audience Engagement**: How viewers interact with works
10. **Temporal Scales**: Time dimensions of the work (instantaneous to evolutionary)
11. **Spatial Scales**: Physical scale (molecular to global)
12. **Power Dynamics**: Relationships of power and control
13. **Documentation Practices**: How works are recorded and preserved

### Notable Artists in the Dataset
- Eduardo Kac (GFP Bunny, Genesis)
- Stelarc (Ear on Arm, Extra Ear)
- Orlan (Carnal Art series)
- Critical Art Ensemble (tactical media, biotech critique)
- Symbiotica (tissue culture and art)
- Heather Dewey-Hagborg (Stranger Visions, DNA portraits)
- Joe Davis (pioneering bioartist)
- Suzanne Anker (Gene Genies, visual genomics)
- Natalie Jeremijenko (environmental art)
- And many more...

## 3. Methodology

### Computational Pipeline

1. **Data Encoding**: Each artwork encoded as multi-dimensional vector representing all 13 dimensions
2. **Axis-Aware Representation**: Preserves semantic distinctions between dimensions
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)
4. **Clustering**: Multiple algorithms tested (K-means, Agglomerative, DBSCAN, etc.)
5. **Evaluation**: Systematic testing of 800+ combinations

### Optimization Process

Tested combinations of:
- Multiple representation schemes
- Various dimensionality reduction techniques
- Different clustering algorithms
- Range of hyperparameters

### Optimal Configuration

- **Algorithm**: Agglomerative Clustering
- **Number of Clusters**: k=15
- **Embedding**: 4-dimensional UMAP
- **Silhouette Coefficient**: 0.664 ± 0.008
- **Trustworthiness**: ≈0.81
- **Continuity**: ≈0.81

## 4. Key Findings

### Finding 1: Artist-Specific Methodological Cohesion
Individual artists tend to develop consistent methodological approaches that persist across multiple works. Works by the same artist often cluster together, suggesting distinctive artistic "signatures" in the multi-dimensional space.

### Finding 2: Technique-Based Segmentation
Bioart works cluster significantly by their underlying biological techniques:
- Transgenic art cluster
- Tissue engineering cluster
- Microbial art cluster
- DNA/genomic art cluster
- Ecological intervention cluster

### Finding 3: Temporal Artistic Evolution
Observable shifts in bioart practices over time:
- 1990s: Focus on transgenic and genetic art
- 2000s: Rise of tissue culture and embodiment
- 2010s: Data-driven and computational approaches
- 2020s: Ecological and climate-focused works

### Finding 4: Trans-Temporal Conceptual Affinities
Despite temporal distance, works share thematic connections:
- Early conceptual pieces connect with contemporary bio-critical works
- Recurring themes: body modification, species boundaries, technological sublime
- Persistent ethical questions across decades
